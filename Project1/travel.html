	<h1>The Luxary of Travel</h1>

	<p>Traveling is the best luxary we have.Traveling allows me to learn about myself in a different setting. Although I'm not only learning more about myself, I get to experience different aspects of the world, differnt cultures and my favorite part trying new foods.I havent been to many places yet, but my favorite trip so far was traveling to Israel, I saw a different part of the world that I fell in love with and wanted to be a part of. </p>

	<p>One of my favorite quotes is "The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page". It speaks to me because as humans we stereotype everything and everyone and we easily do it.Until you travel and discover cultures for yourself. It is hard to change ones mind. So every chance you get to travel, take it !!!</p>
