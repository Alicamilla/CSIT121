		      <p>Music is one of the things I cannot live without. If I go to a day without music everything feels off. I listen to music when I fall asleep and when I wake up because I sleep better with classical music or calming meditation music is playing in the background.</p>

	    	<p>I love going to concerts to listen to my favorite artists live. By doing this I get to not only listen to my favorite songs but feel and connect with them. It is a great experience so I always reccomend people to go to concerts and live shows.</p>
